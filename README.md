#BathJS

Pretty simple JavaScript library to enable basic routing in a lightweight, single page static web-site.

Calling it a single page application (SPA) was giving it too much credit, and thus, the name "Bath" was born.

##Demo

A basic demo can be found at: http://www.jennifersdisneyguide.com/

##Features

* Allows for loading content based on a routing scheme, as opposed to directly loading the files.

##Dependencies

1. Latest version of jQuery.

##Usage

Include the dependencies and `bath.js` into your page and call the following:

```javascript
TODO
```
